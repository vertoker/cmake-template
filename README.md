# CMake Template

(**If you clone it, you better delete .git/ folder and this README.md file**)

My personal CMake template for all of my projects in C++

Template tested in Windows/Linux and on VS Code/Visual Studio

## How to use it

1. Clone it. If you don't know how, well, you need to learn basics

2. Rename cloned folder to your project name (recommend don't use spaces)

3. Open it in your favourite IDE
    - VS Code (I usually use *Ctrl+K* *Ctrl+O*)
    - Visual Studio (inside folder "Open with Visual Studio")

4. In CMakeLists.txt follow comments, setting to your project. You must check:
    - CMake minimum version (recommend not below 3.12)
    - Project name
    - C++ language standard

5. Delete .git/ folder and this README.md

6. Initialize git and create first commit

Congratulation! You setup this template
